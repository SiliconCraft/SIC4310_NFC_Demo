# NFC App Demo

This application is used to demonstrate SIC4310 NFC Demo development kits developed by Silicon Craft Technology Ltd. (SIC). The NFC Demo (SIC4310) is a dual-interface ISO14443A RFID tag, interfacing with both RF and UART. NFC Demo is designed to be used in a various types of applications such as home appliances, personal healthcare, sport and fitness devices, etc. The key challenge is to deploy a low-cost NFC tag instead of an expensive full functional reader IC and use smartphones as a hub of information. As a result, this concept will enable a tremendous number of NFC applications on the smartphones.

Main features of SIC4310
- RF interface based on ISO14443A at 106 kbps
- UART interface 9600 to 115200 bps
- 8 programmable GPIOs
- Activity indicator pins (RF detection, RF busy and power ready)
- 228-byte EEPROM accessible from RF and UART

NOTE:
The application only supports NFC Demo SIC4310 ICs from Silicon Craft Technology.

The demo applications are as follows.
1. GPIOs control
2. LEDs control
3. Firmware upgrade through NFC

6. File transfer 
7. SIC commands
8. Melody
9. Interactive poster
10. E-ink Camera
11. Room Controller 
12. NDEF editor

The development kits are provided in five different forms.

1. SIC4310-MC: a 12.5 x 19.7 mm micro module with a UART interface and 4 GPIOs
2. SIC4310-USB: a 12.5 x 37.3 mm tiny module with a USB interface
3. SIC4310-HV: an energy harvesting module with a UART interface and 3 GPIOs. The on-board inductive antenna can generate a current up to 10 mA.
4. SIC4310-HVU: an energy harvesting module featuring UART and USB interfaces and two LEDs  that can be controlled via GPIO pins. The on-board inductive antenna can generate a current up to 10 mA.
